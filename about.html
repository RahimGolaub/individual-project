                <H2 class="about-us">Home to the very best of automotive creativity. Combining the strengths of some of 
                the world's best drivers and the world as our track, we are an unrivalled creator of automotive 
                programmes reaching audiences around the world.</H2>
                <p class="about-us-body">
                    Our group of petrol-heads are dedicated to brining you the best and latest information out there. 
                    Sure we might be biased at times (Nissan GTR is the best car out there) but that doesn't mean we are
                     giving you our honest opinions.   <br><br>
                    Working with the best writers, directors and programme-makers, we champion automotive creativity, 
                    crafting over 2500 hours of content every year through seven production bases around the world. And 
                    that's not all. We are a committed partner to the UK's thriving independent production community, as 
                    well as other broadcasters and digital platforms, delivering content that showcases the best talent, 
                    stamped with the hallmark of quality.

                    We're a one-stop-shop that touches every aspect of the value chain from production to exploitation - 
                    whether that's financing or developing a show, producing it or selling it globally. And we make sure 
                    it gets to you no matter how you access it: through linear channels or digital platforms, consumer 
                    products, live events and much more. <br><br>

                    Why do we do this? To enhance AutoTube's creative reputation, leverage its intellectual property, 
                    and invest in its content. The revenues we generate supports the wider automotive creative 
                    industries in general and builds awareness of great automotive content. But we also assist the 
                    areas where filming is done by assisting in their releif programmes. Over the last seven years, 
                    we have generated revenues of $1.4bn and returned $200m annually to the world as a whole. <br><br>

                    We strive to be the best automotive content company in the world, attracting the best creative 
                    talents in the business, so that we can bring premium quality award-winning programmes, content 
                    and brands to you no matter where you are. So leave all the hard work to us. And keep it red lined.
